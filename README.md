# linux-interview-prep
Common linux commands and topics to review for interviews and such.

### Please note:

The following list is anything but comprehensive. It also doesn't include basic stuff that one should already be familiar with. Things like `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, the basic Linux Filesystem Hierarchy, etc. This mostly includes stuff that I believe will help me prepare for interviews. 

As always, RTFM.
